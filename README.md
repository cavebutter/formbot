I am old enough to remember the ending of Real Genius, where Laslo uses a computer to
 enter the sweepstakes 4 million times.  
 
 Apropos of nothing, I remembered that scene and decided to see if I could do something
  similar.  I chose this website at random.
  
  **I have not tested it.**
  
  **I do not know if it works**
  
  **I do not condone flooding any website with 2000 random submissions per go**
  
  **Bear in mind that this particular website has a capcha that requires a human to get
   past.  There is a 20 second pause built on to the script to deal with it**
   
 There are some extraneous fields in the `abettors` list due to the mechanics being
  re-used from another app.
  
  This small application was created as an academic exercise and anyone can use it for
   any purpose without attribution or notifying me.
   
   You'll need to download the chromedriver for your version of chrome and extract it to the resources folder.
